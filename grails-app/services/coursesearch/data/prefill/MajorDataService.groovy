        <p>Students who are interested in the environmental studies major are  strongly encouraged to consult the program director at their earliest  convenience, especially because eligibility for particular postgraduate  opportunities may require that students complete additional courses that  are not required for the environmental studies major. Students also are  encouraged to study the webpage of the <a href="http://www.austincollege.edu/envstudies"><strong>environmental studies</strong></a> program.</p>
        <p>Students who plan to major in environmental studies should select  elective courses for the major that are best suited to their particular  interests and should choose a minor (or second major) that best  complements their interests in environmental studies. The director must  approve any courses that are not included in the above list.</p>
        <p>The director must approve the experiential learning activity that  serves as the required project for the major. Possible formats include a  directed study, independent study, honors thesis, or one of the various  non-credit formats such as an internship or summer research position.  Junior status is a prerequisite for project approval. The director must  approve written project plans 12 months before graduation. Upon  completion, students describe their projects in public presentations to  the campus community. Environmental studies majors whose approved  project will not result in course credit (e.g. a summer internship,  service work, or summer research job) should register for Environmental  Studies 480 during the term that they will give the public presentation  on their project.</p>
